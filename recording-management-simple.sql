-- Recording Management System - Simplified Migration
-- This migration adds essential recording management features without complex dependencies

-- Add soft delete and audit columns to lessons table (recordings)
ALTER TABLE lessons ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE lessons ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_edited_by UUID REFERENCES app_users(id);
ALTER TABLE lessons ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS edit_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Create audit log table for recording management actions
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS recording_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  recording_id UUID REFERENCES lessons(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES app_users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  old_values JSONB,
  new_values JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_lessons_deleted_at ON lessons(deleted_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_lessons_last_edited_by ON lessons(last_edited_by);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recording_audit_log_recording_id ON recording_audit_log(recording_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recording_audit_log_user_id ON recording_audit_log(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recording_audit_log_created_at ON recording_audit_log(created_at);

-- Update existing lessons to have edit_count = 0 where NULL
UPDATE lessons SET edit_count = 0 WHERE edit_count IS NULL;

-- Add RLS policies for audit log table
ALTER TABLE recording_audit_log ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
