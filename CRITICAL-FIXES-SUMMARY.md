## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX MANUALLY

### Issue 1: Multi-School Teacher Creation
**File:** `app/create-user.tsx`
**Status:** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
**What to do:**
Add checkbox UI for selecting multiple schools when creating a teacher.
Save to `assigned_schools` array column.

### Issue 2: Chat School Selector Logic
**Files:** `app/(tabs)/student-chat.tsx`, `app/school-chooser.tsx`
**Status:** NEEDS REFINEMENT
**What to do:**
Add logic to check if teacher has one school vs multiple schools.
If one school: skip selector, go directly to chat.
If multiple: show selector with only assigned schools.

### Issue 3: Email Sending
**File:** `lib/emailService.ts`
**Status:** REQUIRES EXTERNAL SERVICE
**What to do:**
Configure SendGrid, AWS SES, or other email service.
Update emailService.ts with actual API calls.
