-- 🚨 FIX RLS INFINITE RECURSION
-- This will fix the circular reference in policies
-- Run this ENTIRE script in Supabase SQL Editor

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: Drop ALL existing policies
-- ============================================
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view other users" ON app_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON app_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage users" ON app_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view published materials" ON study_materials;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can create materials" ON study_materials;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can update their materials" ON study_materials;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can delete their materials" ON study_materials;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can view assignments from their school" ON assignments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can create assignments" ON assignments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can update their assignments" ON assignments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can delete their assignments" ON assignments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can view their own submissions" ON submissions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can create their own submissions" ON submissions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can update their own submissions" ON submissions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can view submissions" ON submissions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can update submissions" ON submissions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can send messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view published lessons" ON lessons;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can create lessons" ON lessons;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can update their lessons" ON lessons;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can delete their lessons" ON lessons;

-- STEP 2: Create SIMPLE policies without recursion
