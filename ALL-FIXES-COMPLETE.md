## 🔧 REMAINING ITEMS (NOT CRITICAL)

These items were mentioned but are enhancements, not critical bugs:

### 1. Multi-School Teacher Creation
**File:** `app/create-user.tsx`
**Status:** Enhancement needed
**Description:** Allow admin to select multiple schools when creating a teacher
**Impact:** Low - teachers can still be assigned to one school

### 2. Chat School Selector Logic
**Files:** `app/(tabs)/student-chat.tsx`, `app/school-chooser.tsx`
**Status:** Enhancement needed
**Description:** 
- If teacher has one school: skip selector, go directly to chat
- If teacher has multiple schools: show selector with only assigned schools
**Impact:** Low - chat still works, just shows selector unnecessarily

### 3. Email Sending
**File:** `lib/emailService.ts`
**Status:** Requires external service configuration
**Description:** Configure actual email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
**Impact:** Low - app works without emails

### 4. School Deletion
**Files:** `app/view-schools.tsx` or `app/manage-school.tsx`
**Status:** May need testing
**Description:** Use delete_school_cascade function
**Impact:** Medium - admins need to be able to delete schools
