## 🔧 REMAINING FIXES TO APPLY

### 10. Fix File Upload in create-material.tsx
**Current Issue:** File upload not working properly
**Fix Needed:**
The file already has upload logic, but needs verification that:
- DocumentPicker is properly called
- File is uploaded to correct bucket (materials or study-materials)
- Database record is created with file_path, file_url, file_name, file_size
- Success message is shown

**Test:** Try uploading a PDF file when creating a material

### 11. Fix Video Upload in add-recording.tsx
**Current Issue:** Video file picker doesn't open
**Fix Needed:**
The file has the logic but needs to ensure:
- DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync is called with type: 'video/*'
- Video uploads to correct bucket (videos or lessons)
- Database record includes video_path and video_url

**Test:** Click "Add Video File" button and ensure file explorer opens

### 12. Fix Chat File Upload in student-chat.tsx
**Current Issue:** Image/document upload not working
**Fix Needed:**
The file has pickImage() and pickDocument() functions with upload logic.
Verify:
- ImagePicker and DocumentPicker are working
- Files upload to 'chat-files' bucket
- Messages are created with file info
- Files appear in chat with preview

**Test:** Try uploading image and document in chat

### 13. Fix Student Submission in submit-assignment.tsx
**Current Issue:** Submit button doesn't work, files don't upload
**Fix Needed:**
The file uses `pickAssignmentFile()` and `submitAssignment()` from fileUpload lib.
Verify:
- File picker opens
- File uploads to 'assignment-submissions' bucket
- Submission record is created
- Teacher can see the submission

**Test:** Student submits an assignment with a file

### 14. Fix Materials Visibility for Students
**File:** `app/student-materials.tsx`
**Current Issue:** Students can't see materials from teachers
**Fix Needed:**
The file calls `getMaterialsForStudentFixed()` which should query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM study_materials 
WHERE school_id = student's school_id 
AND is_published = true
```

Check the `lib/database.ts` file and ensure this function exists and works correctly.

**Test:** Teacher creates material, student should see it

### 15. Fix Teacher School Assignment Display
**Files:** Multiple dashboard and profile files
**Current Issue:** Teachers show "not assigned" despite having school_id
**Fix Needed:**
Search for any code that checks `user.school_id` and shows "not assigned".
Replace with proper null check:
```typescript
const schoolName = user.school_id ? (user.school?.name || 'Loading...') : 'Not assigned';
```

### 16. Fix Chat School Selector Logic
**Files:** `app/(tabs)/student-chat.tsx`, `app/school-chooser.tsx`
**Current Issue:** Teachers with one school still see selector
**Fix Needed:**
In student-chat.tsx, add logic:
```typescript
if (currentUser.role === 'teacher') {
  // Check if teacher has only one school
  const teacherSchools = currentUser.assigned_schools || [];
  if (currentUser.school_id && teacherSchools.length === 0) {
    // Only one school - go directly to chat
    setSelectedSchool(currentUser.school_id);
  } else if (teacherSchools.length > 0) {
    // Multiple schools - show selector with only assigned schools
    router.push('/school-chooser');
  }
}
```

### 17. Add Multi-School Selection for Teachers
**File:** `app/create-user.tsx`
**Current Issue:** Can only assign one school to teachers
**Fix Needed:**
When role === 'teacher', show checkboxes for multiple school selection:
```typescript
{role === 'teacher' && (
  <View style={styles.schoolsContainer}>
    <Text style={styles.label}>Assign Schools (select multiple)</Text>
    {schools.map(school => (
      <TouchableOpacity
        key={school.id}
        style={styles.schoolCheckbox}
        onPress={() => toggleSchool(school.id)}
      >
        <Ionicons 
          name={selectedSchools.includes(school.id) ? "checkbox" : "square-outline"} 
          size={24} 
          color={Colors.primary} 
        />
        <Text>{school.name}</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    ))}
  </View>
)}
```

Save to database:
```typescript
assigned_schools: selectedSchools,
school_id: selectedSchools[0] || null
```

### 18. Fix School Deletion
**Files:** `app/view-schools.tsx` or `app/manage-school.tsx`
**Current Issue:** School deletion not working
**Fix Needed:**
Use the SQL function created:
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase.rpc('delete_school_cascade', {
  school_id_param: schoolId
});
```

### 19. Fix Email Sending
**File:** `lib/emailService.ts`
**Current Issue:** Emails not being sent
**Note:** This requires external email service configuration (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
For now, ensure proper logging and user feedback when email "sending" occurs.

### 20. Update CSV Exports to Remove Grades
**Files:** `app/assignment-reports.tsx`, `lib/csvExport.ts`
**Fix Needed:**
In assignment reports CSV, include only:
- Student name
- Assignment title
- Status (Submitted/Missing)
- Submission date

Remove any columns for: grade, max_score, score, percentage

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Run SQL File**
   - Open Supabase dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Run `COMPREHENSIVE-FIX.sql`
   - Verify all functions and columns are created

2. **Verify Storage Buckets**
   - Go to Supabase Storage

     - study-materials
     - videos
     - lessons
     - chat-files
     - assignment-submissions
   - Set proper RLS policies (public read, authenticated write)

3. **Test File Uploads**
   - Test each upload feature
   - Check files appear in storage buckets
   - Verify database records are created

4. **Test User Flows**
   - Admin creates teacher with multiple schools
   - Teacher creates material
   - Student sees material
   - Student submits assignment
   - Teacher sees submission

5. **Verify CSV Exports**
   - Export users from view-users page

## 📝 NOTES

- All code changes maintain backward compatibility
- Database columns are made nullable instead of dropped
- File upload logic uses multiple bucket attempts for flexibility
- Error handling is improved throughout
- User feedback (success/error messages) is consistent

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING TIPS

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check Browser Console** - Look for error messages
2. **Check Supabase Logs** - Go to Supabase dashboard > Logs
3. **Verify RLS Policies** - Ensure users have proper permissions
4. **Check Storage Buckets** - Verify buckets exist and are accessible
5. **Test SQL Functions** - Run them manually in SQL editor
6. **Check Network Tab** - See if API calls are failing
